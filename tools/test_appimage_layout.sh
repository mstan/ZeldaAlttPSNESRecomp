# test_appimage_layout.sh <AppDir> — prove the packaged layout cannot trap
# user state inside the AppImage.
#
# State policy under test (same as the Windows zip, where everything lives
# next to the exe): config.ini, keybinds.ini, rom.cfg, saves/ and mods/ live
# NEXT TO the .AppImage file. The engine anchors there because host_paths.c
# prefers $APPIMAGE over /proc/self/exe. This script simulates the AppImage
# runtime against a read-only AppDir and asserts:
#   1. first launch seeds config.ini beside the (simulated) .AppImage — in a
#      writable dir, not the payload — plus any release-owned mod catalog;
#   2. a user edit to config.ini and a user-installed mod survive a relaunch
#      (a release refresh repairs its own packages, never user state);
#   3. moving the .AppImage re-anchors state beside the new location;
#   4. nothing is ever written inside the read-only AppDir payload.
#
# A Link to the Past ships no mod packages, so the catalog assertions are
# conditional on the payload actually carrying one; everything else is
# unconditional.
