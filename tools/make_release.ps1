Package a completed A Link to the Past Windows release build.

The build itself is intentionally separate so developers can choose their
toolchain and keep compilation priority under local control. The resulting zip
contains the executable, MinGW runtime dependencies, recomp-ui launcher
assets, configuration, and README. ROMs and ROM-derived generated C are never
staged.

Ships ONE windows zip (and ONLY a zip - never a bare exe; the exe is useless
without its SDL runtime and the recomp-ui assets/ next to it):

  ZeldaALttPSNESRecomp-windows-x64-v<Version>.zip

This script does NOT build. Build first, e.g.:
  export PATH=/c/msys64/mingw64/bin:$PATH
  cmake --build build-recompui -j

The archive is written with portable ('/') ZIP entry names and then re-read to
reject any Windows-only entry name. This is what lets Linux/Steam Deck
extractors rebuild the nested assets/ (and mods/packages/) hierarchy, so a
Windows build running under Proton finds its bundled launcher assets.

Zips land in release-stage\. Publish via gh only after review/sign-off.

Example:
  powershell -File tools\make_release.ps1 -Version 0.9.0 `
    -BuildDir build-recompui -RuntimeBinDir C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
